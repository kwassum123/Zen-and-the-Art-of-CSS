        <h2>What I Found Interesting</h2>
        <p id="para1"> The CSS Zen Garden exists as a reminder that there are many people who can design a website that doesn't look like it's straight
            out of 1998 (me not being one, not for long hopefully). In a less self degredating light, it also exists to show off just some of 
            the many possible ways to make a site appealing; even doing so with a language that some may call simple and easy to use.
            When looking at the sites listed on the right hand side of the page, one can notice the diverse amount of styles that were
            dreamed up by people with much more artistic capacity than myself. The ability to edit the CSS code and make your own submission 
            is pretty neat as well. It also strikes fear into my heart as "Bad Boy" Bradshaw will likely assign us to do so.</p>
        <h2>My Inspiration for This Page</h2>
        <p id="para2">I've been to The Home Depot before and the color scheme was planted into my subconscious until it bore it's fruit 
           as this page.</p>
