        <h1>Zen and the Art of <del>Motorcycle Maintainence</del> CSS</h1>
        <p> The CSS Zen Garden exists as a reminder that there are many people who can design a website that doesn't look like it's straight
            out of 1998 (me not being one, for long hopefully). In a less self degredating light, it also exists to show off just some of 
            the many possible ways to make a site appealing; even done so with a language that some may call simple and easy to use. Even
            when looking at the sites listed on the right hand side of the page, one can notice the diverse amount of styles that were
            dreamed up by people with much more artistic capacity than me. The ability to edit the CSS code and make your own submission 
            is pretty neat as well. It also strikes fear into my heart as "Bad Boy" Bradshaw will likely assign us to do so.
