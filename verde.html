        <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
        <p>This page out of the pushed examples is, in my humble opinion, the cleanest and most representative of zen out of the
          rest. In a past life, I studied Buddist philosophy and spirituality extensively. I became an expert on meditation and was
          able to focus all of my energy on my inner self. When I was first able to do so, I had an epiphany. I had achieved enlightenment.
          In my minds eye, all I was able to see was this most serene webpage. My consciousness was eternally wedded with that of Dave
          Shea's. I saw the beauty of simplicity and layout most easy to read. The implementation of natural themes and a soft green and 
          beige color scheme are but visual icing on the page's cake.</p>
